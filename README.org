* Documentation

The idea is simple, users create a /Smile/ and receive two links: public,
upload. They can share the public link with their friends. The upload
link should be kept private.

They can upload pictures of them or anything that they want to share
with the private link. Visitors on the public link can view the /Smiles/
but only once, pictures are deleted after it's viewed once.

** Why?
